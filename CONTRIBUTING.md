First, thanks to be interested in collaborate on this project. In order to have an idea of the big picture of the project we highly recommend to take a look first to our [wiki](https://github.com/desarrolladorSLP/technovationslp-backend/wiki) 

This project is divided in backend (this repo), an iOS app, an android app and an angular front end your collaboration on
any of them will be greatly appreciated

Check other repos for guidelines for every specific project.

## Guidelines for backend

1. You can take an existent issue or create a new one in order to start working with us. Please anything you want to do must be associated to a well described issue
2. For existent issues please check the [TODO](https://github.com/desarrolladorSLP/technovationslp-backend/projects/1#column-4531426) list. Some issues need to be refined before
they are available to be taken or they are blocked, so only take issues in TODO list. 
3. Create a branch for the issue you will work on and once you have tested locally open a PR for code review.
4. During PR we'll check:
    1. You have included unit tests for your changes
    2. There is no unused or commented code
    3. javadocs are not needed at all but code must be auto-descriptive
    4. Avoid big methods/classes
    5. Have in mind [SOLID](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design) 
5. If you want to add unit tests for existing code only that will be of course appreciated. You can do it but also start please writing an issue for it.
